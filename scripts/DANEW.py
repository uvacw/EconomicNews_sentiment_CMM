abstract = {This article presents norms of valence/pleasantness, activity/arousal, power/dominance, and age of acquisition for 4,300 Dutch words, mainly nouns, adjectives, adverbs, and verbs. The norms are based on ratings with a 7-point Likert scale by independent groups of students from two Belgian (Ghent and Leuven) and two Dutch (Rotterdam and Leiden-Amsterdam) samples. For each variable, we obtained high split-half reliabilities within each sample and high correlations between samples. In addition, the valence ratings of a previous, more limited study (Hermans {\&} De Houwer, Psychologica Belgica, 34:115-139, 1994) correlated highly with those of the present study. Therefore, the new norms are a valuable source of information for affective research in the Dutch language.},

        text : string
            The string (UTF-8) for which DANEW scores should be calculated
        group : string (default="All")
            A string indicating which DANEW sub-group should be used. Can include
            "Women", "Men" or "All".
        fill_value : numeric
            The value to use for words that do not feature in the DANEW lexicon.
            Defaults to NaN, which entails ignoring unknown words. Setting the
            fill_value to 0 implies that unknown words pull the mean sentiment
            closer to 0, reducing the sentiment scores for longer texts.

            subjectivity : float
                The number of non-zero words in the text found in DANEW, divided

            power : float
                The mean of mean power scores for each word in the text, with
                the fill_value used for unknown words.
            arousal : float
                The mean of mean arousal scores for each word in the text, with
                the fill_value used for unknown words.
            complexity : float
